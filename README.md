-*tkinter* using python tkinter i imported the tkinter tool into the program and created a variable called "window" that serves as my screen for the GUI

-*num,alphanum,spalphanum function* it grabs data from a list created for the 3 catagories and uses the value command to enable that setting when the button is pressed

-*creating the password* using another variable i created "result" marking it as a global variable. i then used if/elif statements to make sure the user has input all the options before the password
can fully generate. Then i used both the numerical list and the size function named "length" to react off of my result variable when executed. My result is then returned so the program doesnt loop the password generation

-*saving function* creating a function called "save" i have it open a text document that stores the data from the result variable whenever executed.

thank you for checking out my program!!
